# my-blog

First, you load index.html
The form displays. 
If you input blank and click submit button, alart message is prompted.
If you input all 3 fields then submit, it will direct to the blog page.
You will see the field of your input in the bottom section before footer.

Both index and blog page has a switch button that background change to dark and light.

In blog page, there is a back button on the header that redirect back to main page.

In footer of the blog page, there is a link to the "my blog" page but I just used # for as the demo video does not show to redirect to another page.
